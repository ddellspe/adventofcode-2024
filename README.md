# Advent of Code 2024

I am working the Advent of Code 2024 in Java for my own learning. Each day will be its own package
and tests will allow both the examples and actual answers to be available. To run, make sure you
have maven and java (at least java 21) installed and run the following command:

```sh
mvn clean test
```

I may be blogging some days at [my blog](https://ddellspe.net) so feel free to subscribe/follow for
your own fun.
